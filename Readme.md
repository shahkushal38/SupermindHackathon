# 📊 Social Media Performance Analysis

A basic analytics module to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts. This project leverages **Langflow** for workflow creation, **GPT integration** for insights generation, and **DataStax Astra DB** for database operations.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a streamlined system that fetches, analyzes, and visualizes social media engagement data, providing actionable insights to improve performance. 

### Key Objectives:
1. **Fetch Engagement Data**:  
   Simulate social media engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments, post types) and store them in a DataStax Astra DB database.

2. **Analyze Post Performance**:  
   Build a Langflow workflow that:
   - Accepts post types (e.g., carousel, reels, static images) as input.
   - Queries Astra DB to calculate average engagement metrics for each post type.

3. **Provide Insights**:  
   Use GPT integration in Langflow to generate simple, actionable insights, such as:  
   - "Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts."
   - "Reels drive 2x more comments compared to other formats."

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **[Langflow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)**: Workflow creation and GPT integration.
- **[DataStax Astra DB](https://www.datastax.com/astra)**: Cloud-native NoSQL database for storing engagement data.
- **Frontend**: Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) to display visualizations and insights.
- **Backend**: APIs for fetching and analyzing data using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

## 📋 Features

1. **Data Storage**:
   - Engagement data simulation (e.g., post types, likes, shares, comments).
   - Securely stored in Astra DB.

2. **Post Performance Analysis**:
   - Query engagement metrics by post type using Langflow.
   - Calculate averages for metrics like likes, comments, and shares.

3. **Actionable Insights**:
   - GPT generates insights based on engagement data.
   - Example: "Reels have the highest engagement rate across all formats."

4. **Interactive Frontend**:
   - Visualize insights and engagement metrics through intuitive charts and graphs.
   - Built with React and designed for ease of use.

5. **Backend APIs**:
   - APIs for querying Astra DB and serving data to the frontend.
   - Integration with Langflow workflows.
